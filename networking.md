## TCP, UDP, IP, and ICMP

These protocols form the backbone of the modern Internet. But what are they?

### TCP: Transmission Control Protocol
    
TCP is what is known as a connection-oriented protocol. This means that it is designed to ensure that data is delivered to the destination in the order it was sent, and that the destination acknowledges receipt of the data. TCP is also designed to ensure that data is not corrupted in transit. TCP is used for a large variety of Internet traffic, including web browsing, email, and file transfers. While the *proportional volume* of Internet traffic that is TCP is shrinking, the *absolute volume* of TCP traffic is increasing, as the Internet grows. 

Other services that use TCP as their underlying transport protocol include SSH, FTP, SMB/CIFS, and basically most things outside of streaming.

### UDP: User Datagram Protocol

### IP: Internet Protocol

### ICMP: Internet Control Message Protocol
